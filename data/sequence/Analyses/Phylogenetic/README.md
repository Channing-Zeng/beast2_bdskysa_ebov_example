Analysis of EBOV genome sequence from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2014-2016

#### Contents

Makona_1610_cds_ig.xml - BEAST XML to sample time-structured trees. Data is divided into 4 partitions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd codon position of protein coding regions and non-coding intergenic regions. Skygrid tree prior and uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock.

Makona_1610_cds_ig.MCC.tree - a maximum clade credibility tree constructed from 2 x 100M step runs of the above XML. 

Makona_1610_cds_ig.1K.trees.zip - a ZIP archived file containing a sample of 1000 trees from the above analysis.
