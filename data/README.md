# Raw data

## Sequence data
From https://github.com/ebov/space-time.git cloned on 2018/08/18 (data used in Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic, Nature, 2017).

- Use metadata to get sequence dates and divided into geographic datasests
- Extract sequencing data from XML file (more complicated to extract coding/uncoding regions from the raw alignment).


## Surveillance data
Weekly probably and confirmed cse counts for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (by district) downloaded from http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.ebola-sitrep (in 2016). This includes data from the patient database and WHO situation reports. Where both sources are available for a given week, **combined** counts the maximum of the two.


## Maps
Downloaded from https://gadm.org on 2016/01/22. Since the outbreak administrative divisions of Sierra Leone have changed, meaning that the administrative divisions used to classify sequences cannot be used for newer maps.
